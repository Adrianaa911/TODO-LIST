Created a to-do list webpage where you can add, replace and delete your list. To create this page I've used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

1. had an error- a type error in my code. When applied the Event listener it was null so I've made some changes in my code, starting with html-where I changed the button class into id and modified on js and css style sheet.

2. has an style problem- my tick didn't appeared as It should.

3. the 'deleteAll' button didn't worked and had to fix it by making sure that I don't have a type error.
